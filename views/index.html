        <h2>What is Computer Blocks?</h2>
        <p>
            Computer Blocks is a tool used to simulate digital circuitry and logic gates.
            It is based on a grid and revolves around cables, inverters and source blocks which when used together can theoretically produce any digital program or computer.
            <br><br>
            It is an incredibly versatile and expansive tool, however it can be daunting at first glance.
            We have many plans to help with this problem including in-game tutorials and challenges, a detailed wiki and potentially video guides on YouTube.
            For more information on our further plans read the "What is next?" section bellow and check out our Trello page.
            <br><br>
            The Computer Blocks tool has various blocks with the most basic and fundimental of them being the cable, source and inverter.
            With these three simple objects you can theoretically replicate almost any digital program.
            This can be done by using various logic gates (AND, OR, XOR) to manipulate inputs and produce outputs based on ur circuit.

        <!-- <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
            Computerblocks is a passion project started by a pair of high school students from Melbourne, Australia.
            We started this as a fun little thing to do but quickly our heads filled with new ideas and ambition.
            We hope that someday this could be used by many people for both educational and hobbyist purposes.
        </p> -->

                            We hope to add puzzles set by us as well as eventually having the ability for users to easily create and share there own puzzles.
                            The puzzles which come pre-installed will act as both a incremental tutorial as well as extra challenges for advanced users.
                            This will work but being given a description of what you need to build as well as input and output blocks which will give and recieve certain multiple randomised signals which must be correct in order to complete the level.
                            You may also be given size / layer restrictions or block limits, these will all be up to the creator of the level.

                    <p>
                        We still have a lot of work to do in regards to optimisation and some smaller bug fixes. At the moment the creation of a loop either breaks the game or causes a mass of bugs.
                        Our current solution to this just prevents you from making such loops however this is incredibly intelligent. If anyone believes they may have a solution to this problem feel free to check out the source code and send us an email.
